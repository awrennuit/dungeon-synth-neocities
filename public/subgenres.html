      <h1>Dungeon Synth Subgenres</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          Dungeon synth can be thought of as a subgenre of dark ambient or black
          metal. Thus, subgenres of dungeon synth can be difficult to define. As
          such these are major groupings of styles which have enough albums and
          unique aesthetics to warrant them as subgenres. As with all genres,
          classifications are meant to be tools to find new music and granular
          subgenres of a subgenre might not be what everyone needs. There are
          also lists and videos out there with more genres some of them
          overlapping with others. This page will be updated when other genres
          become unique enough to have their own entry.

          Old school not only refers to dungeon synth made in the 1990’s but
          also the traditional sound of dungeon synth and its proximity to black
          metal. The sound mimics the early days of dungeon synth and its
          aesthetics are closely aligned with black metal.

          Comfy synth became popular in the late 2010’s and had a boom in 2020
          following the pandemic. During this time a lot of similar albums with
          similar themes were produced all with a similar gentle aesthetic.
          Comfy synth became popular due to its break with the dominant
          aesthetic of dark dungeons which was seen in the first wave as well as
          the beginning of the 2010’s revival.

          Winter synth is music with a strong cold aesthetic modeled after
          Jääportit - Kauan koskematon (1999). Winter synth’s aesthetic of
          winter is accompanied by either intense feelings of loneliness or
          magic in solitude. The style can be lo-fi or lush depending on the
          artist but is usually marked by songs and naming conventions based
          around snow and cold atmospheres.

          The combination of chiptune and dungeon synth specifically with an
          aersthetic of TTRPG and CRPG games of the 1980’s and 1990’s. Chip
          synth begun out of the experimentation of dungeon synth in the mid
          2010’s closely aligned with dungeon noise.
