        <h2>Why AI Art is Unethical and Detrimental To Your Project</h2>
        <p>
          Tools have always been used by humans to accomplish tasks. The rise of
          AI software in rendering images is new but already has some concerns
          about its ethics and uses. While rendering an image of an old castle
          or old wizard for your silly little DS project might seem like the
          best course of action, learning how to edit images and text and design
          your own cover is much more fulfilling.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>AI Art Is Counterproductive For Your Project</h2>
        <p>
          Even if you do not have any ethical concerns about AI, using an AI
          prompt for artwork will call into question your music if it is human
          made. There is already a pushback against AI and people will see the
          use of AI and assume your music is also fabricated by prompt
          generation. This could or could not be true but the instances we have
          seen always begin with AI art since that is the first thing people
          see. From a personal anecdote, if I, as a music reviewer, see AI art
          in a bandcamp page when looking for new music to feature, I will skip
          over things with AI art. A person might or might not care about this
          aspect but using AI art will become a distraction and in a small DIY
          community will be counterproductive for your project when making your
          own design is not that much more effort.

        <h2>Suggestion For Basic Users</h2>
        <p>
          There are many designers out there that will work with you to do album
          art. This could be from commissioned art to something basic. If you
          just need an image and text you can use this

        <h2>Suggestions for advanced users</h2>
        <p>
          There are no rules when it comes to design. You can handdraw and
          handwrite all of this material since you are in a genre which
          celebrates human creation. You can also print this out and rescan it
          giving it a in real life paper texture. You can also print it out
          crumble it flatten it scan it back into the computer print it out
          again and then photo copy it three times each pass losing clarity but
          gaining gritty texture. You also do not have to design in a JCARD tape
          format but it is popular in this the DS style.
        </p>
        <p>
          When picking fonts, I find the serif (little wings on the ends of the
          letters) to have an old look to them but they are not the Old English
          Font which every black metal band used. You can also go with old
          English no one is going to arrest you. You can also design your own
          font online or with programs or find old books with handwriting and
          pick put the letters you need to make your own logo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also once you find a look you like, you can save the file and swap out
          art and move around the texture layers or switch them to make them
          look different. Save the tinting until last after you save the file as
          you need to have the whole file flat to to photo filter.

          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <p>
            First, download a template in <strong>psd</strong> format and open
            it up.
          </p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-1.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Next, find an image for your art. It can be commissioned or sourced
            from a public domain site. Be sure to copy down the artist's name so
            you can credit them.
          </p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-2.png" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="with-break with-img">
          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>
            Place the commissioned artwork or public domain piece on the
            template.
          </p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-3.png" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="with-break with-img">
          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <p>
            For this style we are going to desaturate the art and posterize it.
            This makes it even more stark with by turning it black and white.
          </p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-4.png" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="with-break with-img">
          <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <p>
            Match the background of the image with the rest of the tape cover so
            you can grab white and paint bucket the rest of the Tape Mask we
            have been using. You can use the template to add in text and use
            whatever fonts you want. In this example I brought down the image so
            I could fit a logo above the castle. As long as the art is under the
            tape mask you can position the art wherever you want.
          </p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-9.png" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="with-break with-img">
          <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <p>Grab a few textures and put them over top of everything.</p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-5.png" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="with-break with-img">
          <h3>Step 5</h3>
          <p>
            Don’t be afraid to do some experimenting to see what works. The goal
            is to give the image a worn look or something that looks like it was
            left out in the rain for a few days.
          </p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-6.png" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="with-break with-img">
          <h3>Step 6</h3>
          <p>
            Using the blend modes, flip through each one seeing what looks good.
            Some aesthetic choices are Always Hard Mix, Pin Light, Hard Mix,
            Overlay, and Subtraction but there will be no one way of doing this.
            I achieved this look with two textures: one on Hard Mix and one on
            Hard Light. It will also look different depending on what order they
            are in the stack.
          </p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-7.png" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="with-break with-img">
          <h3>Step 7</h3>
          <p>
            If you wanted that tint look: turn off the template layer, save your
            file, then merge visible so you can use the photo filter to pick the
            desired color and opacity.
          </p>
          <img class="art-guide-img" src="images/art-101-8.png" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="with-break with-img">
          <h3>Step 8</h3>
          <p>
            In this example I even went back and threw a few more layers on top
            of it. This is optional and depends on how worn you want it to look.
