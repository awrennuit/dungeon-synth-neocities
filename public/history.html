      <h1>The History of Dungeon Synth</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Dungeon Synth is a style of at-home made fantasy synth. Despite its
          name and aesthetic being a modern incarnation, dungeon synth’s early
          history is rooted in the 1990’s black metal scene, when its members
          created ambient synth projects and circulated those releases through
          tapes. These black metal side projects laid the groundwork for dungeon
          synth’s atmosphere and ethos regarding aesthetics, production, and
          distribution. Today, dungeon synth has become a diverse genre and
          cottage industry with tape labels, forums, festivals, and an
          international fanbase devoted to its history and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Branching out from its "dark dungeon" beginnings, the genre has a
          diverse sound which includes neoclassical, lo-fi, new age, noise,
          medieval, drone, and even chiptune music. Dungeon synth is primarily a
          solo endeavor with the same person writing, playing, producing, and
          distributing the music. The music is done either through hardware
          synthesizers or through virtual studio technology (VSTs) in a digital
          audio workstation (DAWs). Oftentimes, the tape you are buying is
          packed and shipped by the person who made the album.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dungeon synth has a small but active community mostly based on forums,
          discords, and other social media platforms. This network has been
          built since the 2010’s when it became a microgenre following the
          creation of the

          by Andrew Werdna. Since the 2020 pandemic, Dungeon synth has seen
          increased attention leading to an influx of new artists, live shows,
          and a creative boom which is still in the process of happening.
          Dungeon synth, despite being an international community is small with
          the space between fans, labels, and artists almost non existent.

            through tape trading networks as well as record shops, usually in

            a retroactive collected and restructured by modern fans of the
            genre. Some of the original creators of this music are now just
            being made aware of interest in music they made decades prior.

            Håvard Ellefsen, better known as Mortiis, is a project which is
            almost synonymous with classic dungeon synth, or at least the
            history of dark medieval synth. Mortiis to few was the bassist for
            the black metal band
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_(band)"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Emperor</a
            >
            from 1993 to 1994. Mortiis to many more was a milestone in the
            development of what was then called dark dungeon music and a
            waypoint for future composers to model their sound. While Mortiis
            would make a variety of music, it is his “Era I” records or the
            releases that span from 1993 to 1999 that would become the center of
            reverence. <cite>Født til å herske</cite> (Born To Rule) is a 53
            minute song split into two parts, which brings the listener into a
            world of cold and uncaring passages that snake around the undercroft
            of a long abandoned castle. Between shadows and sunlight,
            <cite>Født til å herske</cite> is dramatic in its approach to cast
            emotion and atmosphere in a macabre play. The interplay with the
            keyboards and mixing is something that is both commanding and
            immersive. Mortiis’ instance on the repetitive melodies that make up
            this song is a cornerstone of classic dungeon synth, as the music
            becomes a meditative chant used to transpose oneself to distant
            places. Mortiis would go on to explore different styles in the
            2000’s before returning to his legacy as an alumni in the wake of
            the dungeon synth revival. This music means a lot to its creator
            and, though a lot of Mortiis’ image is the punchline to internet
            jokes, <cite>Født til å herske</cite> and the majority of Era I is a
            testament to the power of this sound.

            Depressive Silence is perhaps one of the most popular if not most
            celebrated early dungeon synth projects. This is perhaps due to the
            fact the band started as a parallel project to the melodic black
            metal band
            <a

              >Mightiest</a

            guitarists / keyboardists who created a synth entity for the 1995
            split with

              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Mightiest</a
            >. While Depressive Silence’s second release
            <cite>Depressive Silence II</cite> is perhaps the more iconic
            release, with its cover almost being symbolic of dungeon synth. In
            the haze of mist and fallen ruins exists the whispers of entities
            that offer no guidance or reassurance.
            <cite>Depressive Silence II</cite> is a solitary adventure with an
            opening that could be one of the banners for classic dungeon synth.
            Both Ral and B.S. would go on to make one-off projects with a final
            release in 1997. These releases all happen to be some of the best
            music made in this time period. Other albums by its creators,

            Secret Stairways was the solo project of US black metal musician

            in 1997 and 1999. Both album’s music was backed by the same sense of
            melancholy that would haunt most of Davis’ music, but a sense of
            twilight wonder with 1999’s <cite>Turning Point</cite> reached the
            zenith of production for these self released projects.
            <cite>Enchantment of the Ring</cite> has become iconic for its
            production and sense of wonder which creeps across the ground like
            fog. For most, Secret Stairways would reach a wider audience decades
            after its initial release and years after the suicide of Davis in
            2011. Both Secret Stairway releases now stand as a shrine to its
            creator, who seemed to be a mage capable of marrying melody with a
            lingering sense of loss and grief.

            (released on Meat Hook Productions who also released Moonsorrow

              >Woods of Belial</a

            Sorvali found the tracks and intended artwork for the record.
            Additionally, 2015 was also the time when dungeon synth was
            experiencing it’s modern revival, which led Sorvali to remaster the
            tracks and release the long awaited demo.
            <cite>The Sleeping Green</cite> is caught between two worlds, as it
            was originally intended to be from the late 90’s but has now had the
            benefit of cleaner, more modern production. It is now we can hear
            Sorvali’s vision, which combines the folk melodies heard on
            Finntroll and Moonsorrow releases with the atmosphere of what would
            later be called dungeon synth. The result is a sound that is both
            enchanting and immersive, and is the best soundscape Lunar Womb
            produced, as it saved an unintentional blueprint for modern dungeon
            synth.

            "Dungeon synth is the sound of the ancient crypt. The breath of the
            tomb, that can only be properly conveyed in music that is primitive,
            necro, lo-fi, forgotten, obscure, and ignored by all of mainstream
            society. When you listen to dungeon synth you are making a conscious
            choice to spend your time in a graveyard, to stare, by candle-light,
            into an obscure tome that holds subtle secrets about places that all
            sane men avoid."

          <p>
            Up until this point, this type of music had no name and was coined
            by this writer out of interest to collect music which had a "weird
            naive magic." Werdna focused his efforts in collecting music from
            the 1990’s which fit this type of aesthetic and wrote reviews on his
            blog. Over time, newer artists who were also interested in this time
            started to create music under the name "dungeon synth." Dungeon
            synth, during its early revival days, existed on MP3 blogs before
            moving over to

            as its premier platform. Around the time of the 2020 pandemic,
            dungeon synth moved from an internet only genre, to a live genre
            with local scenes of musicians working in person to create music.

            — a label specializing in black metal and dark ambient. Til Det
            Bergens Skyggene is a project that was responsible for 5 releases in
            a few short years before ceasing. The third and self titled release
            has grown in legacy in the dungeon synth scene for its reverence to
            the classic sound of the 1990s. With a focus on texture and
            ambience, <cite>Til Det Bergens Skyggene</cite>, the album, moves at
            a glacial pace across a landscape of fog with only shadowy outlines
            of trees and ruined structures. If limbo or the desolate landscapes
            of the afterlife had a soundtrack it would most likely sound like
            the track “Skog, Natt Og Stjerner.” This is a record that does not
            approach pleasantly and, in fact, it does not approach at all.
            Rather, <cite>Til Det Bergens Skyggene</cite> walks ever forward
            through the growing opaque wall of fog uninterested in anything but
            the crawl of time. It is aloof, magical, and completely uninterested
            in being accessible.

            It was a simple video that provided 2 hours and 30 minutes of
            background music for reading, playing games, or whatever the user
            wanted. I feel there is something omnipresent about

            <cite>Another World Another Time</cite> catches the artist as they
            climb out of the classic dark ambient sounds of Tome I-IV to to
            craft a world of imagination and wonder. If I could offer any one
            record which I feel captures the variety in dungeon synth, it would
            be this. Additionally, 2013-2015 would see some truly fantastic
            works from Erang and this release is indispensable in one’s journey
            into dungeon synth.

            Fief is a wonderful artist to start with in dungeon synth as it is a
            very popular sound among fans. In fact, Fief may be one of the most
            popular dungeon synth artists, which is no surprise given the string
            of amazing releases. Rather than a direct narrative, Fief’s five
            albums are vignettes into a medieval world that might or might not
            have any sort of fantasy elements. This is a long campaign in a low
            magic world that is filled with just as much danger and excitement
            as other more dragon-filled narratives. I feel Fief is popular due
            to both accessibility with the production as well as a charm in its
            minimalism. This is tavern music for the weary traveler and while
            there are few patrons, the hearth is warm and roaring. Though all of
            the albums are wonderful, Fief <cite>II</cite> remains one of the

            <cite>Taur-nu-Fuin</cite> was a monumental record on its release. I
            remember when it came out there was something that changed about the
            scene as its release pointed to a new benchmark for direction. With
            it’s cover, which worships the aesthetics of second wave black
            metal, to the sweeping labyrinthine sounds, to the obscure Tolkien
            lore, <cite>Taur-nu-Fuin</cite> was a champion of the classic sound
            that lay in the graves of Mortiis and Wongraven. With four songs and
            a running time of 50 minutes, Thangorodrim is intense in its need
            for commitment. This is not background music rather a passage into
            corridors that lay far out of the reach of sunlight. I would urge
            people to listen to this release for nothing else than to experience
            classic dungeon synth in a modern incarnation.

            DIM represents history being made as, since the release of this
            Canadian artist’s debut, has only become a foundational record in
            what people see as dungeon synth. Far from the dark dungeon sound of
            early dungeon synth and its revival period,
            <cite>Compendium I</cite> showcases neo classical and medieval folk
            in a lush atmosphere devoted to sacred music. This split from the
            pagan and satanic beginnings in black metal represents a new split
            in what could be considered dungeon synth and shows a record that
            might have been one of the first in an ideological split with the
            past.

            Hole Dweller continues what could be seen as a new era for dungeon
            synth. This US artist has had many sounds over the years but
            <cite>Flies The Coop</cite> was perhaps many peoples’ entrance into
            dungeon synth. It is whimsical but it is raw. It is magical as well
            as somber. It was also a sound that was unheard of five years prior.
            When I discuss modern classics, I think of records everyone might be
            familiar with. <cite>Flies The Coop</cite> was the sound of a hobbit
            house in the afternoon and presented low fidelity not as an
            adversarial aesthetic but something comforting. This sound would be
            later explored in full with the comfy synth boom a few years later
            but for now it was the gentle croaking of frogs and the gentle
            melodies of tea time put to tape and then played for a year before
            reaching the right level of fade.

            Few records have captured the imagination of listeners as
            Fogweaver’s. This is perhaps due to the tireless workflow of the
            creator Evergreen and their related projects.
            <cite>Spellwind</cite> was released in February of 2020 a few months
            before the pandemic would shut down most of the world. In hindsight
            it was a time when everyone was uncertain and anxious and perhaps a
            record of calming melodies dedicated to the lore of

            was what everyone needed. Fogweaver would have many albums after
            this as well as other dazzling projects through

            as well as related projects. If any creator can be seen as a pillar
            in the contemporary dungeon synth community, it is Evergreen and
            their entire creative catalog.
