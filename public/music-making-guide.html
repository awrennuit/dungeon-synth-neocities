        <h2>A more in-depth guide following how I make music:</h2>
        <p>
          First I do some planning and outlining. I ask myself questions like
          these:
        </p>
        <ul class="section-list">
          <li>what aesthetic, vibe, or sub-genre am I aiming for?</li>
          <li>
            will there be a story tying everything together or will each song be
            its own story?
          </li>
          <li>what is the setting of the story (or stories)?</li>
          <li>what instruments and sounds make sense for that setting?</li>
          <li>
            do I want to keep things pretty mild or do I want to get
            <em>wild</em>?
          </li>
          <li>how long should the album be?</li>
          <li>given the length, how many songs should I aim for?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once I have fairly solid answers to these questions I start swapping
          between making short musical ideas, working on the story (or stories),
          and start on the album art (or seek someone out to handle that part).
          Iâ€™m going to keep this much more focused on the music making piece of
          this. If youâ€™re curious about how I approach writing the stories or
          making the album art feel free to send me a message. That said, I
          cannot stress enough how important the story/mood/atmosphere part is
          to the creative process. It is <em>vital</em> and truly drives
          creative inspiration. I highly recommend creating an environment that
          works for you - candles, incense, inspiring posters, moodboards,
          reading a book or listening to music beforehand, dimming the lights or
          turning them off completely, putting some swords up on the wall,
          changing into a â€˜ritualâ€™ outfit, spending a week running with the
          foxes or wolves in the woods, communing with faeries & gnomes near the
          magic creek, staring longingly into a goblinâ€™s eyes for 30 minutes,
          whatever works best for you. It helps so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have two basic methods that I use a lot when making music: hooking
          up a MIDI keyboard and playing around until I find something I like,
          and playing around in the Piano Roll until I find something that
          sounds decent. Sometimes the underlying chords come first. Sometimes
          the melody comes first. Sometimes I Most of the ideas made at this
          point donâ€™t make it into the song or the album. Not every idea is a
          keeper, but Iâ€™m a firm believer that making these â€˜badâ€™ or â€˜okay-ishâ€™
          ideas helps get the brain into Creative Modeâ„¢. Sometimes it takes a
          loooong time to get there - weeks even. And other times it happens
          almost instantly. Pro tip: playing only white keys will almost always
          sound good and â€˜in keyâ€™
        </p>
        <p>
          Some â€˜chordsâ€™ (or perhaps more accurately â€˜intervalsâ€™) I like to play
          around with are fourths, fifths, and octaves. These are generally
          pretty strong sounding, and have been used in all sorts of music for
          centuries. If youâ€™re totally new to music making, scales, and whatnot
          hereâ€™s how to find these notes. Start on any white key. Play that
          note. Counting white keys to the right of that note: 1 is the note
          youâ€™re playing, 2 is the next white key, then 3, then 4. Play the 4th
          white key. Thatâ€™s a fourth. A fifth is the same idea - count to 5 on
          the white keys to the right. Make sure to count the key youâ€™re playing
          as 1. An octave (as in 8) is the exact same note that youâ€™re playing,
          but in the next â€˜registerâ€™. You can find it by counting to 8, making
          sure to count the note youâ€™re playing as 1.

        <p>
          I feel like melodies are one of my weak points, and Iâ€™ve been trying
          to work on crafting them. One basic formula Iâ€™ve found to be useful is
          to pick a low note and a high note no more than about 12 notes apart.
          This is the range the melody will stay inside of. Then try to make the
          melody have a rise and fall. The high note should only be hit one
          time. Same for the low note. Remember, this is just a thing Iâ€™ve been
          trying out. Itâ€™s not the best or only way to build a melody.
        </p>
        <p>
          After thereâ€™s a good foundation for either a melody or a chord
          progression (which is a series of chords) I loop it and make some
          options for the other part. Usually this is all done with just one
          track and one VST. More sounds can be added later, and with a DAW itâ€™s
          quick & easy to see what the idea Iâ€™m making sounds like with another
          VST or instrument. I try to make at least 3 or 4 different â€˜optionsâ€™
          to go with the part thatâ€™s looping. Again, this doesnâ€™t have to be
          groundbreaking music. Itâ€™s mostly to get some rough ideas out there.
          Many of them probably wonâ€™t even be used in the final product.
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container">
          <figure>
            <img

            />

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          When thereâ€™s a few ideas Iâ€™m satisfied with I see if any fit together.
          Maybe theyâ€™ll each be in their own songs, but maybe some of them sound
          great together. This is the part where I start planning out the
          structures for the first few songs. Maybe song 1 will have Part A,
          then Part B, then Part A again (ABAB). Maybe song 2 will have a
          verse/chorus type of thing like ABACB. Maybe song 3 will just be Part
          A, but stuff will slowly get layered in on top of it. Some songs will
          have extended intros or outros. The combinations are unlimited:
          ABCABC, ABBACC, ABACDDC, you get the idea. If youâ€™re new to making
          music aim for a simple one like ABAB, ABAC, or ABCBC. Complicating
          things too much can be discouraging and ruin an otherwise good song.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also keep in mind that none of these decisions have to be final. My
          songs go through so many iterations. You never know when youâ€™ll
          stumble across the perfect thing to add in. This is the stage where I
          start experimenting with adding more tracks/VSTs/instruments into the
          mix.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continue this workflow until I have a solid foundation to about half
          the songs for the album. Then I start fine-tuning things a bit more.
          Iâ€™ll make the transitions smooth and add some melodic variations to
          keep the music from becoming stale. By â€˜smooth transitionsâ€™ Iâ€™m
          referring to the place where Part A becomes Part B, etc. Oftentimes
          the notes that lead into the next section will have to be altered a
          bit to keep the transition from being too jarring. Sometimes I add
          some quicker notes that head towards the starting notes of the next
          section. Sometimes I have lower chords fade in for a few beats before
          the next section starts. Stuff like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I add the bells & whistles to the songs. Once most of the
          songs are feeling good I add all the extra stuff in: underlying
          drones, background flourishes, little sound effects at impactful
          parts, field recordings, other background textures. Dungeon Synth is
          all about atmosphere, and these are the things that can turn a good
          song into a great song. In fact, sometimes I start with the background
          textures and drones. Donâ€™t go overboard though. Thereâ€™s a delicate
          balance point where things go from atmospheric & meaningful to
          overused & annoying. Less is more.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there you have it! The album is finished. Again, this is just the
          general approach that I take. I donâ€™t follow this exact pattern for
          every song I make. Experiment and see what works best for you.
          Adventure awaits!

        <h2>Some general creative tips:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            limitations can be excellent - using only 5 instruments/tracks,
            capping the number of effects at 3, only using presets, only using
            sounds you crafted yourself, etc. can help build up your creative &
            innovation skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            deadlines can aid in creativity - not for everyone, but I find that
            having a â€˜due dateâ€™ for my album makes me more likely to work on it
            rather than starting a new album, and another new album, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            focus on â€˜good enoughâ€™ rather than perfection - thereâ€™s value in
            having a high quality song, but thereâ€™s also value in knowing when a
            song is solid enough to be complete...if that makes sense.
          </li>
          <li>
            quality over quantity - may seem like the opposite of the previous
            point, but having 7 quality songs is so much better (and more
            satisfying!) than having 30 low effort songs.
          </li>
          <li>
            focus on the journey rather than the destination - most of us would
            love to have some level of fame in the scene, but being caught up
            with checking views/sales/upvotes/purchases/listens/etc will only
            harm you mentally and make you resent what you do.
          </li>
          <li>
            donâ€™t compare yourself to other artists - to the point above,
            everyone is at a different place in their life and with their music.
            Set some realistic personal goals and make progress towards them.
            Donâ€™t base your success on someone elseâ€™s life.
          </li>
          <li>
            HAVE FUN - this is absolutely the most important thing. If you
            arenâ€™t having fun you should seriously consider taking a break and
            coming back to things when you can find joy and wonder in them
            again. This could be days or it could be months. Creating should be
            fun <3
