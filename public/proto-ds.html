          During the 1980’s, artists producing instrumental synth music and
          releasing it on on private labels made up the majority of what would
          be called new age. Though artists like

          trained, other amateurs making tapes of instrumental synth and drone
          which were circulated among private networks. At around the same time,

          recorded Music Inspired By Lord of the Rings using new technology
          including a moog synthesizer. The musicians could not afford a large
          studio so they put together a small recording space on the remote
          island of Älgö, in the Stockholm archipelago. Though the album has
          other live instruments the album is entirely instrumental and fantasy
          themed with long synth passages. Even earlier than that is the history
          of avant composers and library musicians embracing new and
          inaccessible technology making background music and non commercial
          experimentations with synthesized sound.

          Early history of dungeon synth is an early history of electronic music
          which sees musicians at home creating worlds from synthesizers. Not
          every style of music is going to have simple historic connections;
          rather one could look at dungeon synth as being part of a greater
          family tree of world building through synthesis.

          <p>
            Inter-Dimensional Music Through Iasos was released in 1975 on Unity
            Records. The label was based in California with Iasos’ debut being
            the third in their catalog. This was the only release on Unity with
            all other material by Iasos on his own personal label
            Inter-Dimensional Music. This debut represents an opening statement
            by the artist and a collection of material he had been compiling in
            the mid 1970’s. Through field recordings, traditional instruments,
            manipulated sounds and heavily drone, Iasos debut can be thought of
            as the genesis of what we think of the new age sound. Its vision was
            daring all the while pushing for complete harmony with its
            experimental sound. It is also a record which I feel is the most
            commercial with songs broken up into 3-4 minute tracks instead of
            the future format of 30 minute tracks.

            Sea of Bliss was the third album by Don Slepian and released on the
            independent, if not private, label Plumeria. Slepian was a musical
            prodigy and early practitioner in the electronic instruments often
            using new technology to sculpt sound. Sea of Bliss has become a
            touchstone for many new age revists with Numero Group reissuing the
            record in 2019. As one could expect, the releases from Slepian were
            intimate meditations of drone and minimal ambient. There is a sense
            of perpetual wonder in Slepian’s work and Sea of Bliss is a vast
            expanse of gentle yet unstructured space for one to explore.

            Inoyama Land are a duo of Japanese artists and were a part of the
            quiet wave of environmental music called "Kankyō Ongaku" which
            populated japan in the 1980s. Inoyama Land , along with other
            musicians, were recently rediscovered outside of Japan due to a
            renewed interest in the style and the success of the 2019
            compilation Kankyō Ongaku: Japanese Ambient, Environmental & New Age
            Music 1980-1990. Danzindan-Pojidon was produced by Haruomi Hosono
            and lives in a kingdom of post minimal dreamscapes and soundtracks
            to JRPG games.

            Emerald Web was a duo composed of Kat Epple and Bob Stohl who not
            only recorded delightful ambient music but also saw success in
            producing music for Carl Sagan’s documentaries. Emerald Web was
            successful during their time with Valley of the Birds being a
            triumph among their early releases. Following the accidental death
            of Bob Stohl in 1990, Emerald Web would disband leading to Kat
            Epple’s solo career as well as guest spots on Devin Townsend record.
            The last ten years have seen a wave of remasters and unreleased
            material. This, combined with the renewed interest in the band’s
            material is befitting their stature of the king and queen of dream
            melodies.

            Suzanne Cianni is perhaps the most well known synth artist in this
            list and is usually discussed in relation to other innovators such
            as Wendy Carlos for pioneering women creators. Ciannis’ history
            before Seven Waves is ludicrous and filled with many bits of
            creation including advertisement design, pinball voiceovers, and her
            first release in 1970 which is more musique concrete. Seven Waves,
            Cianni’s most celebrated work, initially only saw a Japanese release
            but soon found international renown due to its sound design and
            unassuming tone.
